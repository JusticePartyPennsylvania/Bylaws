Article IX. Vacancies in Candidate Nominations.
1.The State Committee shall have authority to fill any vacancy in the nomination of Justice Party candidate for any federal or state office, or any other office for which the State Committee has authority to nominate candidates, that may occur as a result of the death or withdrawal of a candidate, the calling of a special election, or other cause, by substituting the name of another candidate and certifying his or her nomination. The Steering Committee shall have the same authority if and only if the deadline for the certification of such nomination lies prior to the next scheduled meeting of the State Committee.
2.Any vacancy occurring in the Justice Party nomination for any county or municipal office, by reason of the death or withdrawal of a candidate, the calling of a special election, or other cause, shall be filled in accordance with the bylaws of the County Committee in whose district the vacancy occurs. If the vacancy is for an office whose district includes portions of multiple County Committees, the County Committees shall decide it jointly in accordance with their respective bylaws.
